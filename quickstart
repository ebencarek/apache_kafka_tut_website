This tutorial assumes you are working in a Unix system.

Download the Confluent Platform, which contains the most recent version of Apache Kafka.

Decompress the file. Then move the entire confluent folder to your favorite installation location, for example, /usr/local

Next, add the location of the Confluent bin directory to your PATH. Add this line to your ~/.bash_profile file: export PATH=<path-to-confluent>/bin:$PATH

Kafka uses a service called Zookeeper under the hood, so we first need to start the Zookeeper server.

In your working directory, download the zookeeper.properties file. Then run:
> zookeeper-server-start zookeeper.properties

To start Kafka, first download server.properties into your working directory. Then in another console run:
> kafka-server-start server.properties

Kafka should now be up and running locally on port 9092. Open another console, and let's create a topic called "test" with 1 partition:
> kafka-topics --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test

We can see this topic by running the list command:
> kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

To send some messages to this topic, we can use Kafka's built in command line producer tool:
> kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test

Anything you type in this terminal will be published to the "test" topic, one line per message.

We can view the messages being published to this topic in another console by running Kafka's command line consumer:
> kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
